                      Majic jewelry design will send the customer approval photos of completed jewelry prior to
                      shipping. All pieces for which the customer has submitted measurements will display the
                      submitted measurements in the approval photos. Digital approval of such photos serves as
                      acceptance of majic jewelry design’s work for the customer. Final payment for approved work,
                      if any, is due prior to shipping the customer’s jewelry.

                  <span class="fs-2 mb-2">Return policy</span>
                  <p>
                      Majic jewelry design accepts returns only under the circumstances expressly enumerated in
                      the following sections of its policies:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Warranty</li>
                      <li>Exchanges</li>
                  </ul>
                  <span class="fs-2 mb-2">Warranty</span>

                  <p>
                      Majic jewelry design warranties all of its jewelry for 90 days after receipt of merchandise
                      against defects in workmanship. To file a warranty claim, contact <a
                          href="mailto:maker@majicjewelry.com">maker@majicjewelry.com</a>
                      with photos of the defective item and highlight the defective portion of the jewelry. Upon
                      approval of a warranty claim, majic jewelry design will provide the customer with a pre-paid
                      postage label with which to mail the jewelry back to majic jewelry design.
                  </p>
                  <p>The customer must package the defective items securely enough so that no additional damage
                      occurs in transit. If additional damage to returned jewelry occurs after documentation of
                      documented defect(s), the buyer is responsible for any loss in value.</p>
                  <p>Majic jewelry design will issue the refund within one business day after inspecting the
                      returned jewelry and replace the jewelry, free of charge and shipping costs, within 10 days,
                      after inspecting the returned jewelry.</p>
                  <p>Majic jewelry design seals all electroplated metal components (except hematite) and many dyed
                      beads before making your jewelry. This extends the initial appearance of those components,
                      usually for many years, but sealants do not last forever, and sealed components will
                      eventually tarnish and dyes might eventually wear off. Therefore, I do not warranty jewelry
                      against tarnishing or dye rub-off/fading.</p>
                  <p>
                      To extend the life of your jewelry, wipe sealed components with a soft cloth after each
                      wearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Usually, items will be about 10% darker than their product photo. This is part of buying
                      jewelry online. Please understand this before purchasing. majic jewelry design will not
                      accept returns for claims that the jewelry you receive is darker than the product photo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Beads made of natural stones will have color variations. majic jewelry design tries its best
                      to have the picture be the closest representation of the beads in your jewelry. However, it
                      is not feasible to get a 100% accurate representation of every bead every time. majic
                      jewelry design will not accept returns for small color deviations from product photos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Typos and mistakes in the description are not grounds for a refund if your jewelry matches
                      the picture in the listing. </p>

                  <p> If a return is not received or is lost or stolen during shipping, majic jewelry design will
                      not reimburse you for the return. You will have to get reimbursement from the United States
                      Postal Service or your shipper! Please consider buying insurance on your returns.
